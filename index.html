    <P>I remember my Dad buying me first Sega Genesis and I beat him in Mortal Kombat. I had to be like 5 years old. It was the first time I beat my Dad in anything.
      Till this day I bring this up to my Dad, I'll never let him forget it. Until I discovered sports, playing video games is all I wanted to do. I started playing 
      baseball at the age of 7. I was somewhat of a natural at( at least that was what I was told).</P>

    <P>My first playing baseball, I hit a homerun in my last game of the year. I was the only kid in my age group that hit a homerun.
      I played baseball every year after that. I graduated from Kimball High School here in Dallas. Then I played baseball at Texas College, where I got my Bachelor Degree in Education. After I got my degree I started teaching P.E in Tyler, Texas. I wanted to move back to Dallas to I received a temporary job teaching Math. I realiezed I wanted a career change and I always had a interest in tech so I took a leap and here I am!</P>
